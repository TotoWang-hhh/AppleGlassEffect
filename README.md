# Apple Glass Effect Using Pygame

> 2025 by rgzz666

This is an experiment to implement Apple's new liquid glass effect, using the pygame module as a graphical interface of showing the final outcome.

Currently, only rectangles and rounded corner rectangles are supported, as the way of handling other shapes are beyond my ability.

Please always note that I am never a CG expert, but an ordinary grade 10 student.

# Current Issue(s)

It is already known that the algorithm of the defeaction offset is not fully correct (due to errors while calculations and derivation). One of the most effecient solution is to use a simplier function to express the offset, and simulate the effect without considering any other physical facts. This will be tried once the project is confirmed to be continued.

Also, beyong the basic blur and deflection effect, the edge diffussion effect is not completed until now. It will be completed once the project is decided to be continued.
