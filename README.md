# Apple Glass Effect Using Pygame

> 2025 by rgzz666

This is an experiment to implement Apple's new liquid glass effect, using the pygame module as a graphical interface of showing the final outcome.

Currently, only rectangles are supported, as the way of handling other shapes are beyond the ability of me.

Please always note that I am never a CG expert, but an ordinary grade 10 student.
